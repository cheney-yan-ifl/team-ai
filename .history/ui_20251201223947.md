# UI Specification: Main Workspace (Slack-Style)

Expanded from PRD §1.1 to detail the primary Slack-like layout plus the right-side detail panel for agent/state information. Focus here is the main page; additional screens (thread view, agent management, workflow dashboards) will build on this. Simplified for the initial release to introduce fewer concepts.

## 1. Layout Overview (Three-Pane + Top Bar)
A. **Top Bar:** Workspace name only (keep minimal at start).
B. **Left Navigation Pane:** Agents list first, then topic/channels list with unread + status badges; “New Topic” action lives here. Keep other sections hidden for now.
C. **Main Chat Column:** Topic intro/banner and message stream for user, primary agent, and observers. Inline state events deferred; thread previews not shown. Thread toggle is a simple “show/hide observer visibility” control. Includes the Bottom Composer (RTE, @mentions, uploads) docked under this column; no additional status lines until needed.
D. **Right Detail Panel (Context/Config):** Current state summary, agent lineup with activity indicators (e.g., “wants to provide feedback”), files/tasks, and timeline. Remove reaction hooks and extra sections for now.

## 2. Right Detail Panel (new vs. baseline Slack view)
A. **Session State Snapshot:** A summary of this topic, updated live. There should be a global organizer agent running behind the scene. (not visible to each chats -- only used for organizing chats.)
B. **Agents:** Primary + observers with role badges; with action badge indicating they are thinking... has something to say...
C. **File/Tasks** Artifactory of this chat
D. **Artifacts & Tools:** Files, tasks, actions, and tool runs associated with the topic; quick open/download.
E. **Timeline:** Recent events (state transitions, tool executions, agent joins/leaves).

## 3. Left Panel
A. **Agents**: define agents model, role.
B. **Topic List**: Historical chats, can pick up at any time.
C. **New Topic**: create a new topic with a name / summary by asking.

## 3. User Journey

### 3.1 Happy Journey

TBD.

## 4. Interaction Details (Main Workspace)
A. **Mentions:** Fast add an observe agent. The first agent is always the Primary agent, (usually set up at the starting a new chat)

## 5. Upcoming UI Docs (to be added)
A. Threaded message details (inline vs. modal)
B. Agent management + persona configuration surfaces
C. Workflow/state timeline deep-dive and dashboards
D. Mobile and narrow-screen adaptations
