# Product Strategy Summary --- Multi-Agent Chat Team

## 1. Vision

Create a natural, human-like group-chat experience where a **small team
of AI agents** works together to help the user---similar to asking a few
knowledgeable friends for opinions and reaching a thoughtful conclusion
together.

The tool should be: - **Simple**, no workflows or complex setup\
- **Familiar**, like a casual group chat\
- **Supportive**, with a clear main agent and subtle assistants\
- **Focused on the user**, not agent-to-agent noise\
- **Adaptive**, with lightweight agent tone/role customization

## 2. Core Idea

A user interacts in a normal chat interface. Behind the scenes: - A
**main agent** leads the conversation with the user\
- Several **observer/supporting agents** provide input, analysis, or
nudges\
- Agents avoid overwhelming the user but contribute where it helps\
- The system forms a **combined, high-quality answer** through soft
collaboration\
- No prior "workflow" design needed---just start chatting

Users experience: \> "A small team of AI helpers, chatting naturally and
giving me the best, well-rounded answers."

## 3. Unique Differentiator

Most multi-agent tools require coding, workflow planning, or technical
setup.\
Your product targets **ordinary users** with **zero preparation**
needed.

Positioning: - **Not** a model comparison tool like LLM Council\
- **Not** a workflow framework like CrewAI or AutoGen\
- **Not** an enterprise-heavy bot\
- Instead: a **lightweight, human-centered, spontaneous multi-agent
chat**

Your niche:\
\> **"Multi-agent teamwork without the complexity."**

## 4. Target Users

-   Everyday users who want better answers than a single AI can give\
-   Knowledge workers who want a "team of helpers" without setting up
    systems\
-   Students, creators, decision-makers, or casual users seeking richer
    perspectives\
-   Small teams in Slack/Teams who just want better group decisions

Not targeting: - Developers needing complex workflows\
- Enterprises requiring full automation pipelines
