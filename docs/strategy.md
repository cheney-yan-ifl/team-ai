# Product Strategy Summary — Multi-Agent Chat Team

## 1. Vision

Create a natural, human-like group-chat experience where a **small team of AI agents**
works together to help the user—just like asking a few knowledgeable friends for their
opinions and reaching a thoughtful conclusion together.

The tool should be:

- **Simple**: no workflows or complex setup.
- **Familiar**: feel like a casual group chat.
- **Supportive**: clear main agent plus subtle assistants.
- **User-focused**: minimize agent-to-agent noise.
- **User feeling obsessed**: Usage should be smooth, simple, easy to understand.
- **Grow while using**: we are able to collect user behavior in the process of usage, so we can improve our systems/agents by it.
- **Adaptive**: lightweight tone and role customization.

## 2. Core Idea

Users interact in a normal chat interface while these capabilities happen under the hood:

- A **main agent** leads the conversation and keeps the discussion grounded.
- Several **observer/supporting agents** supply insights, alternatives, or nudges.
- Agents stay quiet unless their input adds value.
- The system aggregates a **combined, high-quality answer** through soft collaboration.
- No predesigned workflow—just start chatting and the agents organize themselves, only an organizer (invisible to everyone) to nudge the agents for the progress of the conversation.

Users should feel like: “A small team of AI helpers, chatting naturally and giving me the best, well-rounded answers. I won't feel been mislead because of lacking peer review by one agent.”

## 3. Unique Differentiator

Most multi-agent tools demand coding, workflow planning, or extensive setup.
This product targets **ordinary users** with **zero preparation** required.

Positioning:

- Not a model-comparison tool such as LLM Council.
- Not a workflow framework like CrewAI or AutoGen.
- Not an enterprise-heavy bot.
- Instead: a **lightweight, human-centered, spontaneous multi-agent chat**.
- Easy involving different roles (system preset, or user defined)

Niche statement:

> **“Multi-agent teamwork without the complexity.”**

## 4. Target Users

- Everyday users who want richer/non biased answers than a single AI can provide.
- Knowledge workers who crave a “team of helpers” with no systems to configure.
- Students, creators, decision-makers, and casual users seeking broader perspectives.

Not targeting:

- Developers needing sophisticated workflows.
- Enterprises requiring full automation pipelines.
